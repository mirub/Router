Description:

This project represents a simplified version of a router that receives 2 types
of packet protocols: ARP and IP.

In the beginning, I have implemented the parsing of the Routing Table and 
created the structure that was going to serve as it throughout the program.

Then I have sorted the vector decreasingly by the prefix and the mask. This
method has then been used at the Binary Search function to return the best
route for the received IP since it was the most efficient way. (O(log n)) The
search function checks if there is a match for the routing table entry:
- if there is one, it looks fo the biggest mask that saisfies the condition;
- if there is not, if the prefix is smaller than ip_dest & mask, search for a
bigger prefix match, else for a smaller one.

Upon receiving the packet, the ethernet header has been extracted and the type
has been checked:

- if it is an ARP-type protocol:
	- an ether_arp header is extracted as well
	- the type of the ether_arp is ckeched:
		- if it is an ARP_REQUEST, the router would send an ARP_REPLY packet
		that would give the requesting device the mac on the interface it
		requests
		- if it is an ARP_REPLY, the router would add a new entry to the ARP
		table and forward the enqueued packets to their destination

- if it is an IP-type protocol:
	- extract the ip_header and the icmp_header
	- check the new checksum if it is equal to the old one, else drops the packet
	- check the ttl - if the packet is about to expire drop it and send a
	TIME_EXCEEDED ICMP packet to the source
	- check if the router is able to send the packet further - if there is not a
	match in the routing table, send a DEST_UNREACH ICMP packet to the source
	- check if the packet is an ECHO ICMP packet intended for the router - if so,
	send an ECHO_REPLY ICMP packet to the source
	- if none of the above-mentioned cases happen, then the router would check
	if there is an ARP-entry
		- if so, forward the packet
		- else, add the packet to the queue and send an ARP_REQUEST message on the
		interface of the best routin table match;
